# This file outlines an example of how one may define a workflow for deleting data with Transcend.
# In this example, we want to define a pipeline for deleting a set of video files associated with an account.

# Manage at: https://app.transcend.io/infrastructure/api-keys
# See https://docs.transcend.io/docs/authentication
# Define API keys that may be used to integrate into Transcend from a custom
# web service or script.
# When creating new data silos through the yaml
# cli, it is possible to specify which API key should be associated
# with the newly created data silo.
api-keys:
  - title: 'Server Integration: Server Webhook'

# Manage at: https://app.transcend.io/privacy-requests/identifiers
# See https://docs.transcend.io/docs/identity-enrichment
# Define enricher or pre-flight check webhooks that will be executed
# prior to privacy request workflows. Some examples may include:
#   - identity enrichment: look up additional identifiers for that request.
#                          i.e. map an email address to a user ID, s3 keys
#                          or other identifiers required to make the request
#   - fraud check: auto-cancel requests if account or user flagged for fraudulent behavior
#   - customer check: auto-cancel request for some custom business criteria
